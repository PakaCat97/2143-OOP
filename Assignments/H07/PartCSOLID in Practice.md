# SOLID in Practice:

I belive it is not neccessary to strictly follow all the SOLID principles in small projects.
Early code stage code does not require such guidlines becuase the project becomes too abstract
and difficult to understand by overenginerig it. This will make future updates harder to
implent becuase too much time will be spent on trying to understand the code rather than
updating it. Which is needed becuase projects evolve fast. Also early stage code changes a lot.
All the reqirements are still uknown and a lot of code will get thrown away and replaced until
the requrements are made more clear. The YAGNI (you aren't gonna need it) principle applies as 
well becuase SOLID style abstractions solve problems of scaling, maintenance, and flexibility.
Smaller code bases do not suffer from these problems in the early stages.
