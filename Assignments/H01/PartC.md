# Reflection and Short-Answer

## Importance of Constructors:
Constructors help ensure an object starts its lifecycle in a valid state by initializing its data at decleration.

## Role of Destructors:
Destructors are necessary for the fact that they help with memory management, which is especially important in languages that don't have automatic garbage collection.

## Lifecycle Management
If a class does not manage its recources properly then it can lead to issues such as the program slowing down or stack overflow error due to too much memory being allocated.
