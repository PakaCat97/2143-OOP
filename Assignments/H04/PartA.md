# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is when a function or method can behave differently depending on the object that is using it.
For example: a charcter in a video game will have an attack function but depending on the character build the method of attack will change.
For example: a npc villager may have a generic attack however a mage will attack with a spell.
Polymorphisim is a pillar of opp becuase it allows the use for <ins>**flexibility** **reusability** and **scalability**</ins>
