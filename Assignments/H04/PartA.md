### Definition:

Polymorphism is when a function or method can behave differently depending on the object that is using it.
For example: a charcter in a video game will have an attack function but depending on the character build the method of attack will change.
For example: a npc villager may have a generic attack however a mage will attack with a spell.
Polymorphisim is a pillar of opp becuase it allows the use for <ins>**flexibility** **reusability** and **scalability**</ins>

### Compile time vs Runtime:

Compile time polymorphisim happens at compilation and uses the same function and it behaves the same
but just uses different parameters within the same class.
Runtime polymorphisim happens while the program is running and uses a specific implementation of a virtual function 
defined in a base/parent/super class.
Runtime polymorphisim requires
