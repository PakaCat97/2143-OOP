# Inheritance Defininition
Inheritance lets a programer create a new class from an old class. A new class is called
a derived/sub/child/heir class and the old class it inherited from is called
a base/super/parent class. This way the programer can reuse old code and avoid having to 
write the same code over and over again.

### Inheritance: is different from composition because inheritance: "is-a" relationship. Ex: A dog
is an animal. Dog inherits from the animal class. "Strong class based." 

### Composition: 
"Has-a" relationship. Ex:
a car "has-a" engine but the engine can't exist without the car. "Strong part of."

###Aggregation: 
This is also "Has-a" relationship. But the parts can exist seperatly. Ex:
A teacher "Has" students but teachers have lives suprisingly.
